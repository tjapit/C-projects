# C-projects
-  Developed small to medium C programs having several separately-compiled modules
-  Found and eliminated runtime errors using a combination of logical thinking, language understanding, trace printout, and `gdb`
-  Inspected and implemented programs using structures such as enumerated types, unions, and constants and arithmetic, logical, relational, assignment, and bitwise operators
-  Practiced allocation and deallocation of memory in C programs while avoiding memory leaks and dangling pointers. In particular, implemented dynamic arrays and singly-linked lists using allocated memory
-  Developed, debugged, and modified programs using library utilities, including, but not limited to assert, the math library, the string library, random number generation, variable number of parameters, standard I/O, and file I/O
-  Utilized version control tools (`Git`) to track changes and do parallel development of software
-  Learned how to avoid the implications of common programming errors that lead to security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and injection attacks
-  Utilized the security properties provided by cryptographic primitives (e.g., symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, and cryptographic hash functions) to add security to software

## `ballistics`
Calculates and tabulates the travel path of a projectile launched with a given initial speed and angle over a period of time.

## `chop`
Allows users to give an input .txt file to be edited and output to a given file.

## `hmac-sha1`
Hashes the given input .txt file using SHA1 and generates an optional HMAC key when specified.

## `mod-image`
Blurs, brightens, and/or borders the given input .ppm file.

## `reading`
Generates a reading list from a catalog of books that can be filtered through reading difficulty level. Users can add/remove books from their list by specifying their ID.
