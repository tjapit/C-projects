This input file is different.
In all of the others,
the input lines are all the same
length, so you don't have
to worry
about a cols command affecting
just some of the lines.

But, in this file
we can have cases
where
some short lines are unaffected by removing a range
of columns.  Other lines might have
characters removed
from just the
end, while others might have characters
removed from the middle.
